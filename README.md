# Advent of Code 2025

I'm getting a very late start to advent of code to try and exercise my brain a bit.

I haven't had to solve any algorithm related problems at my job, and I felt like I may have been getting a little rusty.

I will also be doing this project without GitHub Copilot or searching up answers in any other AI tools. I want to actually see what I can do here.
